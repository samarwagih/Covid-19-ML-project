# Covid-19-ML-project :

### This project provides a comprehensive approach to analyzing Covid-19 data, identifying critical factors affecting patient outcomes, and developing a robust predictive model to assist in the diagnosis and management of Covid-19.

# Covid-19 Detection End to End Deployment :
### I have done the "Covid 19" project. Originally, the dataset had 1048575 records. Besides, creating 6 different models and tuning their parameters were very useful for evaluating their performance to decide which one is the most effective for predicting Covid 19 From the above results we can see that although we got the highest accuracy (about 91.37%) from Gradient Boosting Classifier algorithms, Comes next the "XgBoost" with an accuracy of 91.20% and with a recall of 91% (both classes).As mentioned above, because of the unique characteristics of the medical industry, correctly predicting Covid such as HIPERTENSION is crucial so choosing which model provided the highest value of Recall should be on the top of priority, also in the feature engineering I create new columns: enhance the predictive power of the dataset.

# Technical aspect :

### - Python 3.7
### - Front-end: HTML
### - IDE: Jupyter Notebook
### - Dataset: Kaggle
### - Deployment: Streamlit

# Data Collection :

### Covid-19 Data Set from kaggle

# Model Creation and Evaluation : 

### - Various classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting Classifier, XgBoost, KNN tested.
### - Gradient Boosting Classifier, XgBoost were given better results. Gradient Boosting Classifier was chosen for the final model training and testing.
### - Model performance evaluated based on accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report.

# Model Deployment :

### The final model is deployed on Streamlit
